Thank you very much for your quick grading on the final exam and your comments. 

I was just curious regarding the grade I received on the final exam. I received 16/40 and comments mentioning that I did not submit question 2 and question 4. Additionally, it mentioned that my question 1 was unable to function and that I am missing many items for all the questions. However, I just checked my submission file and all the questions were completed. I have attached a screenshot below:

Zip file containing all of the completed questions, handed in before the deadline:
[screenshot attached]

I have been unable to connect to CSIL all day for some reason so I don't have any screenshots of my code running, but I tested my questions 1 and 4 many times before submission and they all worked well then.

 
 
It would be great if you could please take another look at my final exam and let me know how it goes, I would really appreciate it! If you need any other details I am happy to provide them. My student number is [my student number].

 
Thank you very much,
Eric

Thank you for your grading and comments on my Assignment 1. I was just curious regarding the grade I received. I received [whatever grade you got/50] and there were many functions that were graded as not working that I believe should have worked. 
For example, I unfortunately got a 0 for my insert function. However, when I tested my insert on my end, it worked well with various different test cases. Additionally, I have double checked my code for many of the functions where I got marks off and I believe they worked in many different situations on my end. I have attached a screenshot below of one of the various test cases where insert and the other functions are working well:
[attach a screenshot of some test cases here]

It would be great if you could please take another look at my assignment and let me know how it goes, I would really appreciate it. If you need any more details or screenshots, please let me know.

Thank you very much,
Kathy
